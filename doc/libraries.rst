Libraries
=========

farm-ng provides open-source software libraries for developing autonomy applications.

These libraries are organized into the following `modules`:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   core_module
   frontend_module

Currently modules may be consumed by downstream projects via source tarballs;
we plan to support package managers such as ``apt``, ``pip``, and ``conda`` in the future.

farm-ng applications use Docker for software deployment. Dockerfiles and images are available on Dockerhub.
