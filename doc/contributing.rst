We welcome contributions to farm-ng ...

TODO is the best place for all development related discussions.


TODO: If you have ideas on how you would like to contribute, it
is a good idea to let us know on the mailing list before you start
development. We may have suggestions that will save effort when trying
to merge your work into the main branch. If you are looking for ideas,
please let us know about your interest and skills and we will be happy
to make a suggestion or three.

We follow Google's `C++ Style Guide
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_ and
use `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for version control.

We use `Github <https://github.com/farm_ng/tractor/>`_ to collaborate, track issues, and
review changes.
