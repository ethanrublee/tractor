We welcome contributions to farm-ng ...

TODO is the best place for all development related discussions.


TODO: If you have ideas on how you would like to contribute, it
is a good idea to let us know on the mailing list before you start
development. We may have suggestions that will save effort when trying
to merge your work into the main branch. If you are looking for ideas,
please let us know about your interest and skills and we will be happy
to make a suggestion or three.

We follow Google's `C++ Style Guide
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`_ and
use `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for version control. We use the
`Github <https://github.com/farm_ng/tractor/>`_ to collaborate and
review changes to farm-ng.

We now describe how to set up your development environment and submit
a change list for review via Github.

Setting up your Environment
===========================

1. Download and configure ``git``.

   ``sudo apt-get install git``

2. Clone the farm-ng ``git`` repository from Github.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/farm_ng/tractor


4. Build farm-ng, following the instructions in
   :ref:`chapter-installation`.

   The ``CMake`` build will download and enable
   the pre-commit hook automatically. TODO
